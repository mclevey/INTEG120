### Complex Systems

I will introduce some of the core ideas from Part 1 of [Melanie Mitchell's *Complexity: A Guided Tour*](https://www.amazon.ca/Complexity-Guided-Tour-Melanie-Mitchell-ebook/dp/B002SAUBWC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2BFRLQ23FZ8K1&keywords=mitchell+complexity&qid=1678021882&sprefix=mitcell+complexity%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-2). It focuses on the foundations of complex systems science, with an emphasis on information, computation, dynamics, chaos, and evolution.
